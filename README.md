# Mac Textbook Exchange Website

This is the code for the textbook exchange site hosted at [http://textbooks.taylorsilva.com/](http://textbooks.taylorsilva.com/)

It was made using the CodeIgniter PHP framework. This was originally made in 2015 for use by McMaster university students. It's a Kijiji style website that matches buyers and sellers of textbooks based on the course code.
